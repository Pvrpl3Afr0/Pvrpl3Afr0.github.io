			<h1> What makes an ethical hacker?</h1>
			
<p> In order to understand what makes an ethical hacker, we must first understand what a hacker is and what hackers aim to accomplish. </p>
			</div>
		<div class=Description>
			<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker" target=_blank>wikipedia</a>, a "hacker" is "any highly skilled computer expert
			capable of breaking into computer systems and networks using bugs and exploits.</p>
			<p> There are however different subgroups of hackers that work to do different things;</p>
			<ul>
			<li> White Hat Hackers </li>
			<li> Black Hat Hackers </li>
			<li> Grey Hat Hackers </li>
			</ul>
			<p> These three groups often clash, as interpreted by the following image which a literal white hat and black hat are depicted. </p>
			<img src="http://www.advancedwebranking.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/black-vs-white.jpg" alt="A evil wizard (Blackhat) vs. a holy knight (Whitehat)">
			<p> Let's start with the most commonly known (and most commonly misinterpeted) group known as Black Hats </p>
			</div>

		<div class=BlackHat>
			<p> Black Hat hackers are individuals who use their knowledge of computer systems (often self taught) to find and explot loopholes in security systems for personal gain, regardless of if their acts are legal or not. These hackers work by themselves or with groups to accomplish malicious goals. </p>
				<p> These black hats are known for going as far as to taking down government coorporations. These negative connotations often result in people mistaking anyone with an interest in computer science to be malicious.</p>
				<p> How do we compare this to the other two groups? First we need a definition of white hats. </p>
		</div>
		<div class=WhiteHat>
			<p> White Hat Hacker is a term for a Computer Scientist / IT specialist who is either self taught or attended a school for computing systems in order to work at companies finding vulnerabilities in their systems and upgrading them.
			The most important distinction between Black and White hats are that white hats tend to never break any laws. White Hats operate under the law to ensure efficiency in their systems and securities. White Hats are what most computer science students end up becoming in the future and are poorly interpreted by media and other social platforms. However, there is a shady area in between known as the Grey Hat scene.</p>
			</div>
			<div class=GreyHat>
			<p> It is known that there is typically a definite white and a definite black, but what's in between? There are hundreds of grey's in between one and the other. This is where Grey Hat hacking comes to play. One of the essential differences is that Grey Hats might use legitimate methods to obtain what they want, even if it means breaking the law, for a greater good. For comparison, let's say two hackers approach a company regarding their systems. A white hat would inform the company and proceed to work from the inside while a Grey hat would forcefully find a vulnerability without permission (which is illegal) and inform said company in order for the vulnerability to be fixed. There are areas where these individuals are considered shady but in reality most enthusiasts and even professionals end up being in this area of grey hat hacking.</p>
